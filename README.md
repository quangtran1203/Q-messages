# Chinese-to-English Translation Webapp (Prototype)

## Overview

This project is a simple web application designed to translate Chinese text into English. This document describes the current prototype version of the application.

The current prototype establishes the basic Flask web application structure, provides a user interface for text input, and demonstrates form submission handling. **Actual translation functionality using an external API is not yet implemented in this version.**

## Features Implemented (Prototype Stage)

Based on the completed development tasks, the current version includes:

*   **Basic Flask Web Server:** The application is built using the Flask framework.
*   **HTML User Interface:** Serves an HTML page (`index.html`) located at the root path (`/`).
    *   The page includes a form with a text area (`chinese_text`) for users to input Chinese text.
    *   A "Submit" button is provided to submit the form.
*   **Form Submission Handling:**
    *   The form submits data via a `POST` request to the `/translate` endpoint.
    *   The backend retrieves the submitted text.
*   **Display of Submitted Text:**
    *   After submission, the `index.html` page is re-rendered.
    *   The original text entered by the user is displayed back on the page.
    *   A placeholder message (e.g., "Translation will appear here.") is shown where the translated text will eventually appear.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Obtain the Project Files:**
    *   If you haven't already, clone the project repository to your local machine.
        ```bash
        # Example: git clone <repository-url>
        cd <project-directory>
        ```
    *   If you have already obtained the project files (e.g., by downloading a zip archive), navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    The key dependencies for this prototype are `Flask` and `pytest`.

## Running the Application

1.  **Navigate to Project Root:**
    Ensure your terminal is in the root directory of the project (the directory containing `app.py`).

2.  **Activate Virtual Environment:**
    If you created a virtual environment, make sure it is activated (see step 2 in "Setup and Installation").

3.  **Run the Flask Development Server:**
    Use the following command to start the application:
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    You should see output indicating the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Open a web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    ```

## Expected Behavior

*   **Initial Page Load (`/`):**
    *   The browser will display a web page.
    *   This page will contain a text area for inputting text.
    *   A "Submit" (or similarly labeled) button will be present.

*   **After Submitting Text (to `/translate`):**
    1.  Enter any text into the text area.
    2.  Click the "Submit" button.
    3.  The page will re-render.
    4.  The text you entered into the text area should now be displayed on the page (likely repopulating the textarea or shown nearby).
    5.  A placeholder message, such as "Translation will appear here.", will also be visible, indicating where the English translation would appear in future versions.

## Project Structure Highlights

*   `app.py`: The main Flask application file containing route definitions and request handling logic for the prototype.
*   `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the user interface.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies (Flask, pytest).
*   `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the application (using pytest).
