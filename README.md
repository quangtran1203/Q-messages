# Chinese to English Translation Webapp (UI Prototype)

## 1. Overview

This project is the initial phase of a simple Python web application designed to eventually translate Chinese text into English.

Currently, the application provides the basic user interface structure. It consists of a Flask web server that serves an HTML page containing a form where users can input Chinese text. **Please note: The translation functionality itself is not yet implemented in this version.**

## 2. Implemented Features

*   A Flask-based web application.
*   Serves a single HTML page (`index.html`) at the root URL (`/`).
*   The HTML page includes:
    *   A title: "Chinese to English Translator".
    *   A form with a textarea for Chinese text input.
    *   A "Translate" button.
    *   Placeholder areas for displaying error messages and translated text (these are not yet functional).
*   The application structure includes:
    *   `app.py`: The main Flask application file.
    *   `templates/index.html`: The HTML template for the user interface.

## 3. Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Flask

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository** (or ensure you have the project files).
2.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project-directory
    ```
3.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # For Unix/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4.  **Install required dependencies:**
    The only external dependency for the currently completed tasks is Flask.
    ```bash
    pip install Flask
    ```

## 4. Running the Application

1.  Ensure you are in the project's root directory where `app.py` is located.
2.  If you created a virtual environment, make sure it is activated.
3.  Run the Flask application using the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4.  You should see output in your terminal indicating that the Flask development server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` or `http://localhost:5000/`. For example:
    ```
     * Serving Flask app 'app'
     * Debug mode: off
     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    ```

## 5. Usage

1.  Open your web browser.
2.  Navigate to the address shown when you ran the application (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).
3.  You will see the "Chinese to English Translator" page with a textarea and a "Translate" button.
4.  You can type text into the textarea.
5.  **Current Behavior:** Clicking the "Translate" button will attempt to submit the form. Since the POST request handling for translation is not yet implemented (as per tasks `PROT-001` to `PROT-003`), your browser will likely display a "Method Not Allowed" error for the `/` path, or the page might simply reload without any translation occurring, depending on the exact server configuration for unhandled methods. No translation will be performed, and no translated text or error messages (from translation logic) will be displayed.
