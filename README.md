# Chinese-to-English Translation Webapp - Initial Setup

## Overview

This project is the initial setup for a simple Python web application designed to translate Chinese text into English.

Currently, the application consists of a basic Flask web server that serves a static HTML page. This page provides the foundational user interface structure for the translation functionality, including a form for text input and designated areas for displaying the translation and any potential error messages. The actual translation logic is not yet implemented in this version.

## Current Features

*   **Basic Flask Application Structure:** A minimal Flask application (`app.py`) has been initialized.
*   **HTML Page Rendering:** The application serves an HTML page (`templates/index.html`) when the root URL (`/`) is accessed.
*   **User Interface Structure:** The `index.html` page includes:
    *   A form (`<form method="POST" action="/translate">`) for submitting text (though the `/translate` endpoint is not yet functional).
    *   A textarea (`<textarea name="chinese_text">`) for users to input Chinese text.
    *   A submit button (`<button type="submit">Translate</button>`).
    *   Placeholder areas for displaying the English translation and error messages.

## Environment Setup

Follow these steps to set up the environment for running the application:

1.  **Python Version:**
    *   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. (Python 3.6 or newer is recommended).

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    *   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    *   Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
    *   Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        # If python3 is not available directly, you might use python, ensuring it's Python 3.x:
        # python -m venv venv
        ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
    *   Your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(venv) Your-Computer:project-directory user$`).

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   With the virtual environment activated, install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        This will install Flask, which is the only dependency at this stage.

## Running the Application

Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed:

1.  **Start the Flask Development Server:**
    *   Ensure your terminal is in the project's root directory and the virtual environment is active.
    *   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        flask run
        ```
    *   You should see output indicating that the Flask development server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. For example:
        ```
         * Serving Flask app 'app'
         * Debug mode: off
         * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        ```

2.  **Access the Application:**
    *   Open a web browser and navigate to:
        ```
        http://127.0.0.1:5000/
        ```

## Expected Behavior

When you access `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser, you should see a web page titled (or containing elements related to) "Chinese-to-English Translation".

The page will display:
*   A text area where you can (theoretically) input Chinese text.
*   A "Translate" button.
*   Placeholder areas where the translation and any error messages would eventually appear.

At this stage, submitting the form will likely result in a "Method Not Allowed" error or similar, as the `POST` request handling for `/translate` is not yet implemented. The focus of this initial version is purely on serving the static HTML structure.
